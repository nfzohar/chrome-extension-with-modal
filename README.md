# Template: Chrome extension with modal

When making chrome extensions, it's annoying that the default tooltip is not customizable.
To bypass this, a modal (HTML dialog) can be used, that can be adapted to your needs.

This ia a template, build with JS & HTML and uses Tailwind Play CDN to provide styles.

TIP: Content (HTML, JS, CSS) should be added to the res/content/ folder.
