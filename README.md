# Template: Chrome extension with modal

When making chrome extensoins, it's anoying that the default tooltip is not costumizable.
To bypass this, a modal (HTML dialog) can be used, that can be adapted to your needs.

This ia a template, build with JS, HTML and uses Tailwind Play CDN to provide styles.

TIP: Content should be added to the ./res/content folder.
