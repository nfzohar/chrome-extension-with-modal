# Template: Chrome extension with modal

*This ia an extension template, build with JS & HTML and uses Tailwind Play CDN to provide styles.*

When making chrome extensions, it's annoying that the default tooltip is not really customizable.
To bypass this, a modal (HTML dialog) can be used, that can be adapted to your needs.

**TIP:** Content (HTML, JS, CSS) should be added to the res/content/ folder.
